# 100doc
one hundred days of code.  exactly what it says on the tin.  this repo, like its owner, is plant-powered, carbon-neutral, and whatever other buzzword shuts up the sjw crowd.

## what will you do?  what are the ground rules?
one hour a day of programming, minimum, any language, any stack, any os, any editor, six days a week (none on sunday).  each day gets an entry in the log.  example:

> day 69: frobnicated the widget to fluctuate the subatomic thrusters and un-fucked the faulty nihilipilification logic.  relevant changesets: 6942069, dcafbad, dedbeef, beefbad.

commit summaries are prefixed with the day number like so:

> day 69: frobnicated subatomic thruster widget

i may mix in some emojis if they make the intent of the commits clearer, see also SG/GitCommits.md.

## この糞はいつに始める？
fuck if i know.  9 august 2023 sounds like a nice day.  (that's tomorrow as i write this.)

## ¿porqué este proyecto no está en twitter?
because twitter was a shitshow before elon bought it, and it's hella worse now.  the racist transphobic pricks are welcome to be racist-er and transphobic-er under elon's "leadership."  and in the immortal words of the one and only Sweet Brown, "ain't nobody got time for that."

also, the bastard ripped off the X11 logo.  :-(

## en quelles langues seront ces cent jours ?
python, mostly.  maybe some js and c, possibly ruby.  i dunno.  whatever the fuck i feel like (which is mostly python, ngl).

see also SG/Python.md for what i consider a non-idiotic python style guide (hint: it's mostly pep 8-based).

## Wirst du während dieser Herausforderung Bier trinken?
ja, sicherlich.  liebe ich Bier.

## what licence is this shit under?
WTFPL.  just do whatever the fuck you want to, man.  we're all bros here, amirite?
